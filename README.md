## Professional Experience

### Global Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies (GIIS), Research Associate (March 2021-Present) (https://www.thegiis.org/giis-member/shirish-maharjan)

- Data Analysis: Conducted vulnerability and adaptation assessments for climate-sensitive diseases and health risks. Analyzed CMIP6/ERA5 data to forecast temperature/precipitation trends and extreme climate indices across Nepal. Performed Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) using Biomod2 (R) to forecast Invasive Alien Plant (IAP) and medicinal plant distributions. Calculated temperature/precipitation trends and statistics using scikit-learn (Python) and Kendall/Trend (R) packages for various projects.

- Machine Learning & Advanced Analytics: Applied supervised/unsupervised ML algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, k-NN, Neural Networks) for climate research and predictive modeling. Implemented statistical modeling techniques (regression, time series, spatial statistics) and Bayesian methods for uncertainty quantification. Evaluated model performance using cross-validation, ROC curves, confusion matrices, RMSE, MAE, and accuracy. Utilized GIS and remote sensing with ML algorithms for spatial pattern analysis, land cover classification, and change detection.

- Programming & Tools: Proficient in Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras) and R (ggplot2, caret) for implementing ML algorithms, data analysis, and visualization.
