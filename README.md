## Professional Experience

### Global Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies (GIIS), Research Associate (March 2021-Present)

- Data Analysis: Conducted vulnerability and adaptation assessments for climate-sensitive diseases and health risks. Analyzed CMIP6/ERA5 data to forecast temperature/precipitation trends and extreme climate indices across Nepal. Performed Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) using Biomod2 (R) to forecast Invasive Alien Plant (IAP) and medicinal plant distributions. Calculated temperature/precipitation trends and statistics using scikit-learn (Python) and Kendall/Trend (R) packages for various projects.

- Machine Learning & Advanced Analytics: Applied supervised/unsupervised ML algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, k-NN, Neural Networks) for climate research and predictive modeling. Implemented statistical modeling techniques (regression, time series, spatial statistics) and Bayesian methods for uncertainty quantification. Evaluated model performance using cross-validation, ROC curves, confusion matrices, RMSE, MAE, and accuracy. Utilized GIS and remote sensing with ML algorithms for spatial pattern analysis, land cover classification, and change detection.

- Programming & Tools: Proficient in Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras) and R (ggplot2, caret) for implementing ML algorithms, data analysis, and visualization.

- Survey & Data Collection: Acquired and analyzed data for climate-resilient agriculture assessment. Led LICCI project surveys capturing local climate change perspectives. Conducted surveys on COVID-19 impacts on conservation in the Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape (CHAL) area.

- Training & Facilitation: Facilitated training sessions on GEE, QGIS, and R for forest officers/rangers/interns in collaboration with FRTC Nepal.

- Project Involvement: Pivotal role in the "RES-WASH" project (IWMI) addressing climate vulnerability in Nepal.

- Satellite Data Analysis & Visualization: Developed interactive dashboard using R Shiny, Plotly, and Laravel for vulnerability, marginalization, and risk assessments. Analyzed MODIS/Landsat imagery using GEE and ArcGIS 10.8 to compute NDVI trends in Nepal's rangelands.

### Aayulogic Pvt. Ltd. (Merojob.com), Python and Django Developer (January 2017 - October 2017)

- Backend Development: Developed and maintained backend systems using Python and the Django web framework, focusing on RESTful API design and implementation.

- UI Development: Contributed to the creation of a new user interface (UI) leveraging the Django framework, emphasizing component reusability and modular design principles.

- Issue Resolution & Documentation: Addressed and resolved ongoing software defects and challenges, ensuring code quality and stability. Documented project progress and technical specifications for future reference.

- Database Design: Designed and implemented backend database schemas and models using Python and Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to optimize data storage and retrieval.

- Collaboration & Feedback Integration: Worked closely with internal teams to incorporate end-user feedback into software enhancements, emphasizing iterative development and user-centric design.
